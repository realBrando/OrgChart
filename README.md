This is OrgChart, a simple database management web app leveraging Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy and a Sqlite database. This app is designed for student organizations to track members, allowing 
users to add, edit and delete members and track various information about each member such as name, age, contact information and a position within the organization. OrgChart also allows
users to generate a member report highlighting specific information for members, allowing users to see all members in their organization. It has an extremely simple frontend, keeping the
focus on the backend functionality and the simplicity of tracking and updating members. 

To run, ensure you are within myenv, and run 'python app.py', which will open the web page on a local web host.
